# Conditional Statements


## Introduction

We can’t do much without logic. The following exercises are a couple of computing problems, that you will have seen before. that you can use to flex your logical muscles on.


## Objective

Start to get familiar with some of the conditional statements in Ruby


## Tasks

Note: If you want to define a method or two during this exercise, you can do this by:

```
def your_method_name(your_parameter1, your_parameter2)
  your_code_here
  last_line #is returned from your methods (return keyword optional)
end
```


### Task 1

Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.


### Task 2

Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements. For example: given the two lists `[a, b, c]` and `[1, 2, 3]`, the function should return `[a, 1, b, 2, c, 3]`.


### Task 3

Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.


### Questions

What does the ‘and’ keyword do? Is there anything special about it?

# String Gymnastics 2


## Introduction

Typically what makes our application unique is based on the input they ask for and what they do with it. Working with strings is something that we do on a daily basis. Luckily Ruby has some great support for string handling and manipulation.


## Objectives

- Dig deeper into the [String](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.6/String.html) and [Regexp](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.6/Regexp.html) APIs


## Exercise

Using the code supplied in [string_gymnastics_2.rb](./string_gymnastics_2.rb), use the shopping list in conjunction with the price list to calculate the total price of the shopping.

At the end of your script simply print a line of the format:

```
The price of the shopping list is: Â£pounds.pence
```

**Note:** This time round, both the price list and the shopping list are in strings. You will need to work with these to create something you can work with.

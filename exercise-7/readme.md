# Shopping Classes


## Introduction

In order to get further we need the code that we write to be well encapsulated.


## Objectives

- Use what you have learnt in the chapters [10-14](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/eloquent-ruby/9780321700308/ch10.html) to start defining classes


## Exercise

write some classes to encapsulate what's was going on in the code you wrote for [String Gymnastics 2](../exercise-6/strings_gymastics_2.rb).

Let the last line of your script read something like the following:

```
till.total # The exact interface is entirely up to you!
```

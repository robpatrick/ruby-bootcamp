# The Animal Quiz


## Introduction

It's time to pull together what we've done till now with a slightly larger exercise. The Animal Quiz is fun and should let you stretch your legs a little bit.

The Animal Quiz requires well defined classes that know their role and some good business logic to glue them together.

Use this as an opportunity to identify anything that is not cemented in your learning yet and go back where necessary.


## Objective

# String Gymnastics 1


## Introduction

Typically what makes our application unique is based on the input they ask for and what they do with it. Working with strings is something that we do on a daily basis. Luckily Ruby has some great support for string handling and manipulation.

This [video](http://www.pluralsight.com/training/player?author=alex-korban&name=ruby-fundamentals-module4&mode=live&clip=4&course=ruby-fundamentals) shows some of those methods in action.


## Objectives

- Start to become familiar with the String API
- Dig deeper into what the collections APIs can do for you:
    - [Array](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.6/Array.html)
    - [Hash](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.6/Hash.html)


## Exercise

Using the code supplied in [string_gymnastics_1.rb](./string_gymnastics_1.rb), use the shopping list in conjunction with the price list to calculate the total price of the shopping.

At the end of your script simply print a line of the format:

```
The price of the shopping list is: Â£pounds.pence
```

**Note:** This time round, the shopping list is in a string instead of an array. You are going to need to use the String API to get back to something you can work with.

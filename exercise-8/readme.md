## Excercise

We just watched a [video](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/rspec-3-best-practices) showing TDD in conjunction with RSpec3.

Implement your own version of Rock, Paper, Scissor. Try and go top down and use all that RSpec has to offer.

**Note:** For the avoidance of doubt.

- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper

# Debugging


## Introduction

On a daily basis you will most likely use your IDE to debug code. However, early on in the course we won’t be using the IDE so it’s good to know a few things about how to debug your code during the early exercises.


## Objective

Use pry-debug to stop at will within your code to see what’s going on.


## Exercises

**Note:** If you have done so already, you will need to install pry-debug and pry-doc by running: gem install pry-byebug pry-doc


### Use Pry Debug

Using the pry-debug in [debug_me.rb](./debug_me.rb)

1. Find out what order the people have been shuffled into before they are printed to screen
2. Look inside one of the objects representing John, David or Matz. Can you find the attribute that holds the data?

    - What’s the name of it?
    - What’s the class of that object?


### Find 3 cool functions

Find 3 cool functions that Pry has and show them off to someone in the group :)
